# Libretalk - Android Chat Application
The Libretalk Android application has been developed during the Waterford Coderdojo Classes of 2013/2014.

This project has been migrated over to a new home here:  https://github.com/coderdojowaterford/libretalk 


The Coderdojo is an open source, volunteer led, global movement of free coding clubs for young people.
